DEPLOYMENT

buildout generates file bin/django.wsgi
You should use this file to serve application.

* Database setup
After you provide connection details for database you can use django to create all necessary tables
Run `bin/django syncdb` and `bin/django migrate` commands.
This app uses django flatpages, you can load it with `bin/django loaddata flatpages.json`

* Static files
By default app serves static and media files in debug mode only

If you are not using S3 storage you should point your webserver to serve media files at /media/
from src/ibstorage/media/

Static url is /static/ . You should point this URL to src/ibstorage/static/
Use `bin/django collectstatic` command to copy all static files to STATIC_ROOT.
You can use '-l' key to use symlinks instead of copy
